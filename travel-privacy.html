									<p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong>&nbsp;We may use cookies and similar technologies, including those from third parties, to collect, analyze and store information and to provide and improve the Services.

								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Third-Party Social Networking Sites.</strong>&nbsp;When you have enabled the use of our Services through a third-party social networking or similar site or mobile or other application (a "Social Networking Site"), such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter, you permit Traveldatediscover to access certain information about you that is made available to Traveldatediscover through or from that Social Networking Site.

By accessing or using our Services through a Social Networking Site, you are authorizing Traveldatediscover to collect, store, retain and use, in accordance with this Policy, any and all of your information that Traveldatediscover has obtained from the Social Networking Site, including to create a Traveldatediscover profile page and account for you.

Your agreement to the foregoing takes place when you "accept" or "allow" or &ldquo;go to&rdquo; (or other similar terms) our application on a Social Networking Site or the transfer of information to Traveldatediscover from such site. If there is information about your &ldquo;friends&rdquo; or people you are associated with in your Social Networking Site account, the information we obtain about those persons may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable Social Networking Site. You acknowledge and agree that Traveldatediscover is not responsible for, and has no control over, any applicable privacy settings on any Social Networking Sites (including any settings related to any messages or advertisements about Traveldatediscover that the Social Networking Site may send to you or your friends).

								</li>

					<h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>This cookie policy explains what cookies are and how we use them on the Services. It also explains how we use other technologies for purposes that are similar to our use of cookies. We encourage you to read the full policy so that you can understand what information is collected by us through cookies and how that information is used.</p>
					<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
					<p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.</p>
					<h3>What are web beacons?</h3>
					<p>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes also called clear gifs or pixel tags). Web beacons are usually a small image located on a webpage or email that you are viewing. The request your Internet-connected device makes to fetch the image from the server/computer it is stored on is recorded and provides us with simple information such as the IP address of the computer wanting to view the image, the time the image was viewed, and the type of browser viewing the image. This information is available to any website you visit. We are able to use it to help us deliver cookies, count visits, prevent fraud and to tell if an email or advertisement has been opened and acted upon. In short, cookies work together with web beacons to accomplish the functions and purposes described herein.</p>
					<h3>What are cookies used for?</h3>
					<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our website is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
					<h3>What types of cookies does Traveldatediscover use?</h3>
					<p>The types of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of the following categories: strictly necessary, analytics, functionality, advertising and social media. In order to provide you with the best browsing experience, Traveldatediscover uses cookies from all of these categories. You can find out more about the cookies we use from each of the categories in the table below.</p>
